## Build process setup

Sections `Prerequisites` and `Setup` should be done only once per build host

### Requirements

* Docker CE 17.12.0+ (https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* Docker Compose 1.10+ (https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/)

### PHP 7.4 Requirements

1. Complete build of libzip on CentOS 7 (https://github.com/aursu/rpmbuild-libzip)

### Prerequisites

1. `Docker` should be installed on build host following these instructions:

    https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/#set-up-the-repository

    and

    https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/#install-docker-ce-1

2. `Docker Compose` should be installed on build host following instructions:

    https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose

3. Add your build user into docker group (required to manage docker):

    ```
    usermod -aG docker <username>
    ```

    and relogin

4. Start Docker daemon

    ```
    systemctl enable docker
    systemctl start docker
    ```

5. Port 80 on build host should be free (stop nginx/httpd or move to different
port)

### Setup

1. Clone build repo with submodules:

    ```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/aursu/rpmbuild-php-7.4.git
    cd rpmbuild-php-7.4
    ```

2. Setup build environment:

    2.1. Setup rpmbuild base images

    ```
    docker-compose -f rpmbuild/docker-compose.yml pull
    ```

    2.2. Run webrepo service and createrepo service (see
https://github.com/aursu/docker-rpmbuild/blob/master/README for details)

    ```
    [aursu@envy rpmbuild-php-7.3]$ docker-compose -f rpmbuild/docker-compose.yml up -d
    [aursu@envy rpmbuild-php-7.3]$ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                 COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
    b7d45e6da842        rpmbuild:webrepo      "/usr/sbin/httpd -DF…"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   rpmbuild_webrepo_1
    cda096b8ca05        rpmbuild:createrepo   "/bin/sh -c /usr/loc…"   About a minute ago   Up 42 seconds                            rpmbuild_centos7repo_1
    90705414e549        rpmbuild:createrepo   "/bin/sh -c /usr/loc…"   About a minute ago   Up 42 seconds                            rpmbuild_centos6repo_1
    ```

    2.3. Wait about 1 minute before any other build operation

### Build process


1. Build images

    ```
    docker-compose build
    ```

2. Build packages

    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    command above will start all build services in background. But it is possible
to run any of them or run in foreground etc

3. Wait until command `docker-compose ps` returns all services in state 'Exit 0'

### Access RPM packages

1. Just browse on build host URL http://localhost/ or
2. use `docker cp` command from container `webrepo` from path `/home/centos-7/rpmbuild/RPMS`

### Cleanup build

To complete all build processes run commands:

```
docker-compose down
docker-compose -f rpmbuild/docker-compose.yml down
```

These commands will stop and remove all containers but not build images (see
`docker images` and `docker rmi` commands manuals)
